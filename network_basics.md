## **Q. What is a Network?**

-   A **network** is a system of connected devices (computers, servers, mobile phones) that can communicate and share data and resources with each other.
-   **Purpose**: Enables communication, sharing of resources (like printers or files), and internet access across connected devices.
-   **Example**: The internet is a large global network connecting millions of devices.

## **Q. Types of Networks**

1. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
    - Small, used for devices within a few meters (e.g., Bluetooth or USB connections).
2. **LAN (Local Area Network)**:
    - Covers a small geographical area like a single building (e.g., home or office Wi-Fi).
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
    - Spans a city or large campus; larger than LAN but smaller than WAN (e.g., city-wide Wi-Fi).
4. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:
    - Covers a large geographical area, such as multiple cities or countries (e.g., the internet).
5. **CAN (Campus Area Network)**:
    - Specific to campuses or universities, connecting multiple LANs in a defined area.
6. **SAN (Storage Area Network)**:
    - Focuses on providing storage access to servers (e.g., NAS).
7. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
    - Creates a secure network over the Internet, used for privacy (e.g., accessing a work network securely from home).

## **Q. Network Topology**

-   **Network Topology**: A network diagram that depicts the physical and logical network connections between devices.

## **Q. Types of Network Devices**

1. **Router**:
    - Directs data across networks, typically used to connect a local network to the internet.
2. **Switch**:
    - Connects devices within a LAN, directing data to the correct device in the network.
3. **Hub**:
    - Simple device that broadcasts data to all devices in a network; less efficient than switches.
4. **Bridge**:
    - Connects two LANs, acting as a single network.
5. **Modem**:
    - Converts digital data to analog for internet connectivity over telephone lines.
6. **Access Point**:
    - Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
7. **Firewall**:
    - Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic to enhance security.
8. **NIC (Network Interface Card)**:
    - Hardware that allows a device to connect to a network.
9. **Gateway**:
    - Connects networks with different protocols, enabling them to communicate.

## **Q. Different Layers in the OSI Model**

The OSI Model has **7 layers**, each responsible for specific network functions:

1. **Physical Layer**:
    - Deals with the physical connection between devices (e.g., cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer**:
    - Ensures error-free data transfer between two nodes (e.g., MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer**:
    - Routes data from one device to another using IP addresses (e.g., routers).
4. **Transport Layer**:
    - Manages end-to-end data transfer and error recovery (e.g., TCP/UDP protocols).
5. **Session Layer**:
    - Manages sessions and connections between devices (e.g., login sessions).
6. **Presentation Layer**:
    - Translates data into a format that applications can read (e.g., encryption/decryption).
7. **Application Layer**:
    - Provides services directly to users (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

## **Q. IP Address and Its Classes**

-   **IP Address**: A unique identifier for devices on a network, typically written as four numbers separated by dots (IPv4) or eight groups of hexadecimal numbers (IPv6).

**IP Address Classes**:

1. **Class A**:
    - Range: `1.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.0`
    - Used for large networks (e.g., ISPs, large corporations).
2. **Class B**:
    - Range: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.0.0`
    - Medium-sized networks (e.g., universities).
3. **Class C**:
    - Range: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.0`
    - Small networks (e.g., home networks).
4. **Class D**:
    - Range: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for multicasting.
5. **Class E**:
    - Range: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
    - Reserved for experimental purposes.
